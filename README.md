yeah yeah whatever who am i to decide who gets what grade? what are you going to do about it? anyway, it's
a static comparison site grading AI vendors on cost and usage API transparency. if it's helpful to you, great. if not,
i don't know man

## what this is

can i get cost from your api? great. can i get usage from your api? cool. can i get both? do you have some sort of
billing export? sick

## what am i doing next

- improvement of the dataset by addition of fields: `scope`, `auth type`, `unit`
- in a more fun & perfect world, some CSMs at these vendors reach out to me to confirm and I slap a `verification` badge on their line item
- more fun filtering
- click on the provider, card expands with more information

## what have i done

##### 2.26.26

- Added `domain` metadata and filter
- New `verified` badge for Runway
- Changes to `costApi` field based on new criteria

## what to do to contribute

something wrong? don't know what to tell you dog. open a PR. go tell the mayor
