    per run. Must multiply by the model's published hardware rate (e.g.
    $0.0001/sec for CPU, up to $0.0122/sec for 8x H100) to get USD cost.
    No billing export. Cost visibility roadmap deprioritized post-Cloudflare
    acquisition.

    Separate platform APIs exist: GET /v1/models/pricing returns USD unit
    prices per endpoint, GET /v1/models/usage returns historical usage with
    cost in USD. No billing export. Must use platform APIs separately from
